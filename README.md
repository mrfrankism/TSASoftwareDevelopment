<div><p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Our Problem</b></font><hr /><p align="left">At the beginning of every year the administration of our school faces a great challenge sorting all of its stuents into their approraite classes. Problems such as blank periods, mutiples of the same class, or overlapping schedules, run rampant. The counselors rush to fix the students' schedules. 
<hr/></div>

<div><p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Our Solution</b></font><hr/><p align="left">We invisioned a system that would create students schedules based on the needs of the student body. The master schedule would need to take into account all the classes available to the students, how many students are in each class, and how many periods of each class the school needs. We created a system that produces a master schedule with the least amount of conflicts. The students, teachers, and classes are all stored in a database that takes the counselors input. This database can be modified easily through the use of our GUI. The program then calls the database and algorithmically sorts through all the data and outputs a possible master schedule. It also denotes where schedule conflicts were anavoidable, so that the administration can better deal personally with a student's specific need.
