<div><p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Our Problem</b></font><hr /><p align="left">At the beginning of every year the administration of our school faces a great challenge sorting all of its stuents into their approraite classes. Problems such as blank periods, mutiples of the same class, or overlapping schedules, run rampant. The counselors rush to fix the students' schedules. 

<hr/></div>



<div><p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Our Solution</b></font><hr/><p align="left">We invisioned a system that would create students schedules based on the needs of the student body. The master schedule would need to take into account all the classes available to the students, how many students are in each class, and how many periods of each class the school needs. We created a system that produces a master schedule with the least amount of conflicts. The students, teachers, and classes are all stored in a database that takes the counselors input. This database can be modified easily through the use of our GUI. The program then calls the database and algorithmically sorts through all the data and outputs a possible master schedule. It also denotes where schedule conflicts were anavoidable, so that the administration can better deal personally with a student's specific need.

|11/26/2015|Started the GUI class for one of the windows for the GUI|2Hrs|Franco|Make sure to have ssh on the server computer so we ca acccess it over the internet and make any changes we need to do to the server when we are at the competiton, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!|
|11/24/2015|Fixed/cleaned up a lot oof code in our main class and simplified the way classes are wrtten to the database|2.5Hrs|Hannah, Gabriel, Franco|Made it so that the actual class names show up rather than just "MATH1, MATH2.."|
|11/05/2015|Addede more code to the sorting algorithms, incorporated some more key aspects of our sorting algorithm intothe periodGenerator class   |2Hrs|Hannah, Gabriel, Franco|Things ran fairly smoothly, no big errors thankfully|
|11/03/2015|Started coding algorithms to sort units into periods|3Hrs|Hannah, Franco|Ran into some errors that were easily fixed, continued learning how to communicate with Mysql through JAVA|
|10/22/2015|Tested our method on paper of how to sort the periods of each class|3Hrs|Hannah, Franco, Gabriel|Began making the class to sort the periods|
|10/20/2015|Made a new class to hold the different courses|4Hrs|Hannah, Franco|Had one million and one errors to solve, really difficult|
